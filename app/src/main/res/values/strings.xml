    <string name="apod_title_tools_text">Dusty With a Chance of Dust</string>
    <string name="apod_explanation_tools_text">It\'s storm season on Mars. Dusty with a chance of dust is the weather
        report for Gale crater as a recent planet-scale dust storm rages.
        On June 10 looking toward the east-northeast crater rim, the Curiosity rover\'s Mastcam captured this image
        of its local conditions so far. Meanwhile over 2,000 kilometers away, the Opportunity rover
        ceased science operations as the storm grew thicker at its location on the west rim of Endeavour crater,
        and has stopped communicating, waiting out the storm for now. Curiosity is powered by a radioisotope
        thermoelectric generator, but the smaller Opportunity rover uses solar panels to charge its batteries.
        For Opportunity, the increasingly severe lack of sunlight has caused its batteries to run low.</string>
