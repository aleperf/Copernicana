## Copernicana
<i>Explore Earth and Space with the beautiful imagery provided by the Nasa APIs</i>

Copernicana is an app for exploring Earth and Space through the beautiful imagery provided by
the Nasa API and with the latest informations about astronauts in space and about the
International Space Station.
The app is divided in three main sections: <br>
#### APOD SECTION <br>
 This section is dedicated to the Astronomy Picture of the Day (a.k.a APOD).<br>
 Every day Nasa chooses a significative astronomic picture commented by a professional astronomer (all the
images can also be seen at this website:​https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html
The app shows the image of the day with the same description provided by Nasa and it allows
the user to save the image in a list of favorites. The user can search for a previous APOD for a
specific day in time and save it in favorites as well. The user can see all the previous APOD
saved previously in the database. API docs at: ​https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod <br>
#### EPIC SECTION <br>
 ( or The Blue Marble section), dedicated to images by the EPIC camera (Earth
Polychromatic Imaging Camera) on board of the DSCOVR. The images show the Earth seen from space, as in the following picture: <br>

<br>
The app shows the latest images in natural and enhanced colors from the Epic camera. A
search section allows the user to search for Epic images for a specific day. Both images of the
day and searched images can be saved in a list of favorites.
API docs at: ​https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#EPIC​ and ​https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/api <br>

#### ISS SECTION <br>
A section dedicated to the International Space Station and to astronauts in space. The app
shows the latest position of the ISS.
The app lists the astronauts in space now and shows some information about them (pictures,
brief bios, social media contacts).
